# glEndMyLife()

So I decided to learn some OpenGL in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) as it is more fun than C.
Maybe I will use it to make someting worth mentiong someday.

For now [here is 2D taht is rotating image around all its axes](https://imgur.com/ty0mXbC).

Also, I am following this [great tutorial/book](https://learnopengl.com).
